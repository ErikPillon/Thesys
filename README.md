## Abstract
We study theoretically electronic models with long range Coulomb interactions on low-dimensional frustrated lattices. We will explore the emergence of collective excitations in strongly interacting electron systems as well as the possible realization of non-conventional quantum states. The models developed to this scope will be analyzed using appropriate many-body approaches, both analytical (perturbation theory in the strong coupling limit, random phase approximation) and numerical (extended dynamical mean field theory, exact diagonalization, classical and quantum MonteCarlo simulations).

## Keywords
Long range electron-electron interaction, strongly interacting systems, non-conventional quantum states, perturbation theory, random phase approximation, extended dynamical mean field theory, exact diagonalization, classical and quantum MonteCarlo simulations.
